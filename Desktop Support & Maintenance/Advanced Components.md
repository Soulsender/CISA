## Memory
##### Buffered Memory (RDIMM)
- includes buffer between IMC and DRAM chips
- register between IMC and actual memory
- helps to control electrical load on memory bus
- when you add more memory the electrical load on the bus increases
- improves system load and integrity

##### Memory CAS Latency
- Column Address strobe latency (CAS)
- CAS latency is measured in clock cycles
- lower CAS latency gives better memory performance

##### Error Correcting Code (EEC)
- includes additional bits for error detection and correction
- improves reliability

## Expansion Cards
##### PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express)
- aka dedicated cards
- designed to use particular expansion bus standard
