- data definition language (DDL)
- data manipulation language (DML)
- database management system (DBMS)
- index
- table
- XQuery
- file types
	- primary `.mdf`
	- secondary `.ndf`
	- log files `ldf`
#### Constraints
- limitations or rules placed on a field
- ex. age cannot be negative number
- unique
	- guarantees values will not repeat one another
- check
	- define logical condition
	- will evaluate to t/f
- default
	- when no data is provided at insert time
	- db will automatically use the defined value
	- if not used, db will use null value
- not null
	- will not accept null values
- primary key
	- each table can only have one primary key
	- ex. BCIT uses your A123456 number
	- most unique
	- more detailed, more requirements
- foreign key
	- reference another parent table
	- basically like a pointer
#### Database Types
- flat-type database
	- two dimensional table of rows and columns
- hierarchical database
	- similar to tree structure
	- parent tables have child tables
	- only one parent for each child
- relational database
	- similar to hierarchical database
	- can have multiple parents
#### Interactions
- SQL CMD
	- command line application that allows SQL queries to be written and executed from cmd
- transact SQL
	- primary means of programming and managing SQL server
	- exposes keywords
	- SSMS is just transact SQL under the hood
