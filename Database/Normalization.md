#### Forms
- first normalization form (1NF) eliminate repeating groups
	- no duplicate records
	- must have primary key
	- cannot have multivalued attributes
	- entries must be same data type
- second normalization form (2NF) eliminate redundant data
	- entirely based on dependency 
	- if an attribute depends on one primary key attributes but not the others, this violates 2NF
- third normalization form (3NF) eliminate columns not dependent on key
	- transitive dependencies
		- when attribute1 is dependent on attribute 2 which depends on the primary key
	- must not contain columns that aren't fully dependent on the primary key
- fourth normalization form (4NF) isolate independent multiple relationships
- fifth normalization form (5NF) isolate semantically related multiple relationships
