- prepares network data for physical network
- responsible for NIC communications
- enables upper layers to access media 
- controls how data is placed and received on the media
- error detection
- accepts data (usually later 3 ipv4 packets)

### IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Sublayers
- **Logical Link Control (LLC)**
	- communicates between networking software and the device hardware at lower levels
	- adds layer 2 control info
- **Media Access Control (MAC)**
	- hardware specific
	- provides data link layer addressing
	- controls NIC
	- data encapsulation
		- **frame delimiting**
		- **addressing**
		- **error detection**

#### Topologies
- **half duplex**
	- device cannot simultaneously transmit and receive
	- WLANs use this
- **full duplex**
	- both devices can transmit and receive at the same time

#### Access Control Methods
- contention based access
	- all nodes operating in half duplex
	- includes
		- wireless LAN
		- legacy bus-topology ethernet LAN
		- legacy ethernet LAN using hub
- controlled based access
	- each node has its own time to use the medium
