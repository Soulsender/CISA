- flexible
- uses light
- classified into two types
	- single-mode fiber (SMF)
	- multimode fiber (MMF)
	- dispersion differs between types
		- dispersion is the spreading out of a light pulse over time
		- more dispersion = more signal strength loss
		- MMF has higher dispersion than SMF
		- MMF has limited range
#### Single-Mode Fiber
- uses expensive laser tech
- consists of a small core
- popular in long-distance situations
- lower dispersion than MMF

#### Multimode Fiber
- larger core
- LED emitters
- light enters at different angles
- popular in LAN because LEDs are cheaper
- provides bandwidth up to 10 Gbps over link lengths of up to 550 meters
- higher dispersion
